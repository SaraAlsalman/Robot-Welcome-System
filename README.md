# Robot-Welcome-System
This is a robot welcome system, it is started when the robot detects an object at a distance of 335 cm for 3 seconds, it sends signals to the motors in the hands to make certain movements and sends a signal to the Bluetooth to activate the robot's screen.
Note: I used another Arduino instead of Bluetooth because it is not available in the tinkercad.
